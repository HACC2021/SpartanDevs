# SpartanDevs

Hi everyone!  We are the SpartanDevs team representing Maryknoll High School!  We are excited to present our submission for the Pono Points Game!  We enjoyed working on a solution that addresses ways to preserve our culture, environment, and promote awareness to our island visitors. 

We created a game that works like the “heads up game”, where groups can play together on various topics: Local Customs, Sensitive Hawaiian Environments, Leave No Trace Ethics, Safety, and Neighborhood Sensitivities. 

Each 5-question quiz is randomly generated from our question bank. Scores will depend on accuracy, correct answer streak, and time spent answering each question.

Challenges: Currently working on shifting our server to host our data from local to secured.

What we learned: Effective communication, delegating of tasks, and bringing all our pages together.

Proud of: First Maryknoll School coding club competition entry. Finding a group of coders on campus to build together.
